## Prompt

[No direct user prompt - generated as part of tasks phase after planning]

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for Phase 2 Task Management API with 8 user stories covering all CRUD operations and database initialization. Organized tasks in phases with proper dependencies, parallelization opportunities, and implementation strategy.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for API development with clear phases and dependencies
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/002-web-api/tasks.md with detailed implementation tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation following the task list
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing
